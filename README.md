# Voyant-Tutorial
An introduction to corpus analysis with Voyant.

[Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/) is an open-source, web-based environment for reading and analyzing texts, and is designed with both students and scholars of digital humanties, and the general public in mind. 

## About this tutorial:

This tutorial is intended to provide a basic introduction to Voyant and its tools for text analysis.  It will direct learners on how to access the web-based platform through their browser and how to install a desktop version for private and offline use, guide them through the creation of a corpus, introduce them to basic means of text exploration with Voyant's default suite of interactive tools, and introduce additional tools for more advanced textual analysis. In addition, this tutorial will provide learners with a brief overview of exporting data and embedding Voyant tools in other projects.

This tutorial was originally designed for use by the 2022 cohort of Digital Scholarship Summer Fellows at Bryn Mawr College and may therefore at times direct the learner towards particular textual corpora relevant to that program.  You are encouraged to make use of textual corpora which better suit your own reasearch needs and interests.
