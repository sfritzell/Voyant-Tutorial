# Creating a Corpus

There are four basic ways of creating and using a corpus in Voyant. (A "corpus" is a set of documents). 

1. Open an existing or sample corpus
2. Type or paste text into the main text box
3. Type or paste one or more URLs into the main text box
4. Upload files from your computer

Take a moment to practice creating corpora from different sources. You may find it helpful to keep the following in mind:

- typing or pasting text into the the main box is okay for short documents, but you will probably want to upload longer documents
- enter one URL per line
- when uploading you can use Shift and CTRL to select multiple files
- you can create a zip file on your computer and upload that, rather than selecting multiple documents
- you can click on the "home" icon in the upper right hand corner to start over

You can refer to the [Voyant doucmentation](https://voyant-tools.org/docs/#!/guide/corpuscreator) for additional details on creating a corpus from different file formats.

## Adding text from *Encyclopedia of the Dog*

Let's create a corpus related to the ongoing work of the 2022 Digital Scholarship Summer Fellows program at Bryn Mawr College. (If you're not a current DSSF, feel free to create a corpus that speaks to you!)

Navigate to the current [*Encyclopedia of the Dog* website](https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/dog/). Let's copy the URLs for each chapter in English translation and add them to the main text box in Voyant. (Remember, only one URL per line). When you've added each URL, hit "reveal" to create your corpus!
